\section{Problem Statement}
\hspace*{1.5cm}Today smart phones are not exclusive property of early adopters or IT professionals.
Global Smart phone shipments grew a relatively healthy 43 per cent year-over-year to reach
600 million units in Q2 2010. According to comScoreâ€™s report, 234 million Americans
subscribed to mobile phone plans in January 2010. Of these 42.7 million owned internet
accessible smart phones, this represented an 18 per cent increase over the three months ended
in October.\\
\hspace*{1.5cm}Important progress in mobile computing should start with straightforward local
convergence of Smartphones and computer infrastructure via simplistic mobile use model.
This use model would enhance the current synchronization schemes by by-passing the
synchronized data over proprietary services and giving the user the full control and full
accessibility of his/her own data both on the smart phone, as well on his very own
synchronization server. It is not always advisable for users to use synchronization services
provided by Google for android devices.\\
\hspace*{1.5cm}These services may not ensure full privacy of all the data of the user. This data is
stored on the Google clouds. Also, today the security issues in cloud computing have not
been fully resolved. Hence it cannot be said our data remains fully secure when it is on
Google premises. Synchronization can be done by various means by the use of this product.
Offline and online mode synchronization is possible. Online mode can be used when user is
on-the-go and offline synchronization may be used when user is at the office or at home.\\
