\textbf{Software Testing}
\\\hspace*{0.82cm}Software testing is the process used to assess the quality of computer software. Software testing is an empirical 
technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test, 
with respect to the context in which it is intended to operate. this includes, but is not limited to, the process of executing a 
program or application with the intent of finding software bugs.\\[0.5cm]
\hspace*{0.82cm}There are many approaches to software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs or inspection are considered as static testing, 
whereas actually running the program with a given set of test cases in a given development stage is referred to as dynamic 
testing.\\[0.5cm]
Software testing is used in association with verification and validation:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Verification: }Have we built the software right (i.e., does it match the specification)?
 \item \textbf{Validation: }Have we built the right software (i.e., is this what the customer wants?)
\end{itemize}

\hspace*{0.82cm}Software testing can be done by software testier. until the 1950s the term software tester was used generally, 
but later it was also seen as a separate profession. Regarding the periods and the different goals in software testing there 
have been established different roles: test lead/manager , tester, test designer, test automater/automation developer, and test 
administrator.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Test plan:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}It is a systematic approach to testing a system such as a machine or software. The plan typically contains a detailed understanding of what the eventual
workflow will be.\\[0.5cm] 
\textbf{Test bed:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}It is a platform for experimentation for large development projects. Test beds allow for rigorous, transparent and 
replicable testing of scientific theories, computational tools, and other new technologies.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Test environment:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}In software, the hardware and software requirements are known as the test bed. This is also known as the test 
environment.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Scenario testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Scenario testing is a software testing activity that uses scenario tests, or simply scenarios, which are based on 
a hypothetical story to help a person think through a complex problem or system. they can be as simple as a diagram for a testing 
environment or they could be a description written in prose.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Test case:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Test case in software engineering is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine if a 
requirement or use case upon an application is partially or full satisfied. It may take many test cases to determine that a 
requirement fully satisfied. Test cases are often incorrectly referred to as test scripts. Test scripts are lines of code used 
mainly in automation tools. written test cases are usually collected into test suites.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Unit testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Unit testing tests the minimal software component or module. each unit (basic component) of the software is tested 
to verify that the detailed design for the unit has been correctly implemented. In an object oriented environment, this is usually 
at the class level, and the minimal unit tests include the constructors and destructors.\\[0.5cm]
\hspace*{0.82cm}Integration testing exposes defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components (modules). 
Progressively larger groups of tested software components corresponding to elements of the architectural design are integrated and 
testing until the software works as a system. System testing tests a completely integrated system to verify that it meets its 
requirements. System integration testing verifies that a system is integrated to any external or third party systems defined in 
the system requirements.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Black box testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Black box testing treats the software as a black box without any understanding of internal behavior. it aims to 
test the functionality according to the requirements. Thus the tester inputs data and only sees the output from the test object. 
This level of testing usually requires through test cases to be provided to the tester who then can simply verify that for a given 
input, the output value (or behavior), is the same as the expected value specified in the test case. Black box testing methods 
include: equivalence partitioning , boundary value analysis, all - pairs testing, fuzz testing , model-based testing, traceability 
matrix etc.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{White box testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}White box testing, however is when the tester has access to the internal data structures, code, and algorithms. 
White box testing methods include creating tests to satisfy some code coverage criteria. For Example, the test designer can 
create tests to cause all statements in the program to be executed at least once. Other examples of white box testing are mutation 
testing and fault injection methods. White box testing includes all static testing.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Alpha Testing:}\\
Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users customers or an independent test team at the developer's 
site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing. Before the software goes 
into beta testing.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Beta testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Beta testing comes after alpha testing. Version of the software , known as beta versions , are released to a limited 
audience outside of the programming team. The software is released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product 
has few faults or bugs. Sometimes, beta version are made available to the open public to increase the feedback field to a maximal 
number of future users.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Regression Testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}After modifying the software, either for a change in functionality or the fix defects, a regression test re-runs 
previously passing tests on the modified software to ensure that the modifications haven't unintentionally caused a regression of 
previous functionality. Regression testing can be performed at any or all of the above test levels. These regression tests are 
often automated.\\[0.5cm] 
\textbf{Sanity test:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Sanity test is a basic test to quickly evaluate the validity of a claim or calculation. in mathematics, for example, 
when dividing by three or nine, verifying that the sum of the digits of the result is a multiple of 3 or 9 (casting out nines) 
respectively is a sanity test.\\[0.5cm]
\textbf{Smoke testing:}\\
\hspace*{0.82cm}Smoke testing is a term used in plumbing, woodwind repair, electronics and computer software development. It refers 
to the first test made after repairs or first assembly to provide some assurance that the system under tests will catastrophically 
fail. After a smoke test proves that the pipes will not leak, the keys seal properly, the circuit will not burn, or the software will 
not crash outright, the assemble is ready for more stressful testing.\\[0.5cm]
